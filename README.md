# Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL

### Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL is used to analyze healthcare data â€” including patients, doctors, appointments, and billing details â€” to find valuable insights and improve hospital operations.

---

### Database Structure
| Table | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| patients | Stores patient details like name, age, gender, city |
| doctors | Contains doctor details and their department |
| appointments | Tracks patient visits and assigned doctors |
| billing | Manages payments, bills, and pending statuses |

---

### Tools Used
- MySQL  
- MySQL Workbench  
- GitHub  

---

### Example SQL Queries
1. Total revenue per doctor â€” `GROUP BY` + `SUM()`  
2. Patients with pending payments â€” `JOIN` + `WHERE`  
3. Top 5 patients by billing â€” `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT`  
4. City-wise revenue â€” `GROUP BY city`  
5. Rank doctors by appointments â€” `RANK()`

### Key Learnings
- Creating and joining multiple tables  
- Using aggregate functions and subqueries  
- Applying window functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)  
- Extracting business insights from real-world hospital data
